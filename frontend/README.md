## Overview

The Stutter Enhancer frontend is a single-page web application, developed using React and Vite, focused on user-friendliness and intuitive operation, with a modern and sleek design.

## Build and Deploy with Docker

The frontend can be easily containerized and deployed using Docker.

1.  **Build the Docker Image:**
    After cloning the repository, navigate to the root of your project and run:
    ```bash
    docker build -t frontend:<version> Stutter-enhancer/frontend
    ```
    Replace `<version>` with your desired tag.

2.  **Run the Docker Container:**
    Deploy with a command like:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5173:5173 --net deployment_ainet --name frontend frontend:<version>
    ```
    Ensure the `deployment_ainet` network exists or adjust as needed. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.


## Usage Flow

1.  **Recording:**
    * Click the microphone button to start recording.
    * Use pause/resume buttons as needed.
    * Click upload when finished.

2.  **Processing:**
    * The app sends the recording to the backend.
    * A loading state is shown during processing.
    * Transcribed text is displayed when ready.

3.  **Text Correction (Optional):**
    * Edit the transcribed text if needed.
    * Click submit to send corrections for enhancement.
4.   **Polling:**
        * The UI enteres a processing state, until the backend returns an enhanced audio.

5.  **Results:**
    * View a side-by-side comparison of original and enhanced audio.
    * Play either version with waveform visualization.
    * Download either vanilla or enhanced audio files
